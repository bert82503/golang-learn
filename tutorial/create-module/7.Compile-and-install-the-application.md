In this last topic, you'll learn a couple new go commands. 
While the go run command is a useful shortcut for compiling and running a program when you're making frequent changes, 
it doesn't generate a binary executable.

This topic introduces two additional commands for building code:
* The go build command compiles the packages, along with their dependencies, but it doesn't install the results.
* The go install command compiles and installs the packages.

1.From the command line in the hello directory, run the go build command to compile the code into an executable.

2.From the command line in the hello directory, run the new hello executable to confirm that the code works.

3.Discover the Go install path, where the go command will install the current package.

4.Add the Go install directory to your system's shell path.

5.Once you've updated the shell path, run the go install command to compile and install the package.

6.Run your application by simply typing its name. 
To make this interesting, open a new command prompt and run the hello executable name in some other directory.
