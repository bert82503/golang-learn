/*
Go supports anonymous functions, which can form closures.
Anonymous functions are useful when you want to define a function inline without having to name it.

This function intSeq returns another function, which we define anonymously in the body of intSeq.
The returned function closes over the variable i to form a closure.

We call intSeq, assigning the result (a function) to nextInt.
This function value captures its own i value, which will be updated each time we call nextInt.

See the effect of the closure by calling nextInt a few times.

To confirm that the state is unique to that particular function, create and test a new one.

The last feature of functions weâ€™ll look at for now is recursion.
